    <h1>Helping Predict Momentum in the Economy</h1>

    <div>
        <h2>Motivation</h2>
        <p>To demonstrate which factors are most impactful to an economic recession, our tool will compare the patterns today with previous recessions. All the data used will be pulled from the Federal Reserve Economic Data (FRED) to ensure accuracy. Our end users of our tool would be anyone interested in the economy and financial markets. This would include students, professors, economists, etc. For our users to get a better sense of the state of the economy, we want our users to be able to look at our visualizations and instantly draw conclusions. When looking from an investorâ€™s perspective, the longer they stay invested in the market during a recession the more money they lose. By using our tool, the user would be able to avoid this and get out of the market before it crashes. Which would drastically save their investment whether it be a retirement fund or personal portfolio.
