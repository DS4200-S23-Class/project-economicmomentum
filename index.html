    <h1>Helping Predict Momentum in the Economy</h1>

    <div>
        <h2>Motivation</h2>
        <p>To demonstrate which factors are most impactful to an economic recession, our tool will compare the patterns today with previous recessions. All the data used will be pulled from the Federal Reserve Economic Data (FRED) to ensure accuracy. Our end users of our tool would be anyone interested in the economy and financial markets. This would include students, professors, economists, etc. For our users to get a better sense of the state of the economy, we want our users to be able to look at our visualizations and instantly draw conclusions.</p>
        <p>When looking from an investorâ€™s perspective, the longer they stay invested in the market during a recession the more money they lose. By using our tool, the user would be able to avoid this and get out of the market before it crashes. Which would drastically save their investment. Whether it be a retirement fund or personal portfolio.</p>

        <h2>Background</h2>
        <p>The domain task that our visualization or visualizations support is the analysis of economic data and the correlation between those data points and the health of the overall economy. Many times, this analysis is ultimately used to predict moves in the stock market. However, that is an ancillary use of this analysis and not something that we are focusing on with our visualization.  It is important to support this specific domain task because the US economy is the largest economy in the world and when it moves in one direction the rest of the world tends to move in an identical fashion. Therefore, in our visualization we are looking to have multiple line charts showing a variety of different economic metrics like CPI, PPI, nonfarm payrolls, etc., against the growth of the US economy. We will have a slider feature where the user can change the time period that they are looking at as well as a toggle feature for each data point so the user can pick and choose which data to add to the chart from a menu of different economic data points.</p>
        <p>The visualization does not only help active participants in the stock market, but also aims to be a useful tool for students and researchers who are looking to see and understand how economic cycles have looked historically and if there are any patterns in the data that were not known previously. </p>
        <p>Again, all of these correlations are meaningful to find because an economic recession can lead to millions of people losing their jobs, increases in gasoline and food prices, and higher home prices. Because of this, knowing when an economic recession is going to occur before it happens can potentially lessen the impacts to millions of U.S citizens. For example, another result of an economic recession is the collapse of the stock market. Therefore, if an investor knows when a recession is going to occur, they can get out before the market crashes.</p>
        <p>As many of us college students are taking out loans or investing in the stock market, the knowledge of an incoming recession would help us all out and save us from a potential costly situation. Not only college students but an economic recession would affect everyone in one way or another. </p>
        <p>We want to look at data from previous economic recessions and compare them with each other as well as present day. This will help us build an understanding of the economic factor that can lead to a recession By looking at previous patterns of data, we can use them to predict what potentially could occur in the future. </p>
